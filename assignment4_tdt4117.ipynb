      "urlLink Workplace : \"For INFPs the job search can be an opportunity to use their creativity, flexibility and their skills in self-expression. They can generate a variety of job possibilities, consider them for their ability to fulfill their values, and pursue them using their skills in communicating with others, either in writing or in person. Their idealism, commitment, flexibility and people skills will usually be communicated to others in the job search. Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search. Under stress, INFPs may become quite critical of others and themselves, and they may hold themselves back because they feel incompetent as they engage in this process. They can benefit from allowing their intuition to give them a new perspective on the possibilities available in the situation. They may also find it helpful to truly acknowledge their skills, as well as the importance of communicating those skills to others. In addition, INFPs can benefit from developing realistic expectations about the job search, and from objectively looking at the logical consequences of the various decisions they make. \"\n",
      "My Real Job   It is frustrating, this waiting, this wondering about what exactly it is that I am supposed to be doing here  on this earth, in this house, with this life.  Sometimes, I cramp with shoulds;  the inside voices, huddled together, scheming over plans written in the past.  Sometimes, I burn with maybes;  lofty ideas about what a better person I might become.  I am seldom content with  the moment , unless in silence,  in meditation,  in contemplation and recognition that it is all I have.\n",
      "Being constantly screwed over by your job but still being paid well and not wanting to ruin your resume by quitting before you put in two years has to be one of the most frustrating situations in the world.\n",

      "I must say, you make a fine point. I capitulate in part to your theory in regard to such lame productions being partially for the purpose of appeasing one's partner, whether she be blonde or he a thug. And I also acknowledge the fact that many people watch movies and television to forget about their hard day's work. The only problem is, I am of the opinion that many people don't even think while they are  at  work. In which case, they should certainly be making up for it when they finally get home.  However, there are many of us (though growing less, it seems) who watch films for the artistry of such things as direction, cinematography, acting and set design. There is nothing I love more than a grim, morbid-looking film, a pure hit for the aesthetic-dependent. Directors like David Fincher, actors like John Malkovich, and films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are worthy of such praise. One does not float into such films for a no-brainer, but are often woken up by the sheer talent of those involved in its production.  One of the detrimental facts of our present culture is its dependence on icons of happiness and frovility. Feeling sad? Get a hit of happy-go-lucky Coke. Feeling stupid? Go and see Legally Blonde, with the ever-so-blonde Reese Witherspoon, idolatress of the pre-pubescent generation. That should sort things out.  Because if pretty little Reese can be smart and blonde  (yet still stupid),  so can I ! The prevalence of popstars and celebreties rather than bands or musicians has infested our airwaves. I doubt Britney Spears even knows how to read music. She is an iconic vehicle for the money-making machine that is the contemporary music industry.  Therefore, in defense of my first statement, I must acknowledge, but not agree with your statement. There is nothing wrong with dumbing-down entertainment products for mass consumption after a hard day's work. But when the entire culture becomes dumbed-down, when everything you see and hear is made simple for easy digestion, it becomes crass, oversimplified and degenerative. Anxst has been buried under a snowball of pretty things and distractions. Independent thought has been smothered in bombardment from logos, images, advertisements of all kinds. We are told how to think. How to feel. How to react. And I bet pretty little Reese reacts exactly the way you expect her to. The usual tossing of the hair, poor-me syndrome followed by the notoriously easy-and-fun rise to popularity.  Yay.\n"

Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search.

I capitulate in part to your theory in regard to such lame productions being partially for the purpose of appeasing one's partner, whether she be blonde or he a thug. And I also acknowledge the fact that many people watch movies and television to forget about their hard day's work. The only problem is, I am of the opinion that many people don't even think while they are  at  work. In which case, they should certainly be making up for it when they finally get home.  However, there are many of us (though growing less, it seems) who watch films for the artistry of such things as direction, cinematography, acting and set design. There is nothing I love more than a grim, morbid-looking film, a pure hit for the aesthetic-dependent. Directors like David Fincher, actors like John Malkovich, and films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are worthy of such praise. One does not float into such films for a no-brainer, but are often woken up by the sheer talent of those involved in its production.  One of the detrimental facts of our present culture is its dependence on icons of happiness and frovility. Feeling sad? Get a hit of happy-go-lucky Coke. Feeling stupid? Go and see Legally Blonde, with the ever-so-blonde Reese Witherspoon, idolatress of the pre-pubescent generation. That should sort things out.  Because if pretty little Reese can be smart and blonde  (yet still stupid),  so can I ! The prevalence of popstars and celebreties rather than bands or musicians has infested our airwaves. I doubt Britney Spears even knows how to read music. She is an iconic vehicle for the money-making machine that is the contemporary music industry.  Therefore, in defense of my first statement, I must acknowledge, but not agree with your statement. There is nothing wrong with dumbing-down entertainment products for mass consumption after a hard day's work. But when the entire culture becomes dumbed-down, when everything you see and hear is made simple for easy digestion, it becomes crass, oversimplified and degenerative. Anxst has been buried under a snowball of pretty things and distractions. Independent thought has been smothered in bombardment from logos, images, advertisements of all kinds. We are told how to think. How to feel. How to react. And I bet pretty little Reese reacts exactly the way you expect her to. The usual tossing of the hair, poor-me syndrome followed by the notoriously easy-and-fun rise to popularity.  Yay.\")])\n",
